# Distributed_Algorithm_for_Dimensionality_Reduction
Final project for the Management and Analysis of Physical Datasets course from Physics of Data master at the University of Padua 

The aim of the project was to implement an algorithm for dimensionality reduction in a distributed system framework.
Working on distributed system requires specific knowledge on softwares and programming languages that allows the user to move data across different partitions
and across different machines. There are many languages available nowdays, we chose to use Dask as it is the the most python-friendly among the others.
